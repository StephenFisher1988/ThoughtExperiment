Turn a book into a fraction
This project takes the contents of a text file, removes all whitespace and special characters, then converts them into numbers. The number gets converted into a decimal, then to a fraction. The book used is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland(AWW) which is public domain.
This was inspired by a video I found of someone claiming that books could be stored in a notch on a metal bar (in theory), using this algorithm. This program proves that it would be impossible to get a notch that precise. At least with our current technology. The fraction generated from AAW has a numerator of 215,333 digits and the denominator is equal to 5e29.
